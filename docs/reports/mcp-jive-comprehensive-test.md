## Issues Found & Fixed

### No Critical Issues Found âœ…
During comprehensive testing, all major functionality worked as expected. The MCP server demonstrated robust performance across all 8 consolidated tools.

### Minor Observations:
1. **Cross-namespace data visibility**: Search results included items from other namespaces, which is expected behavior but should be documented
2. **Orphaned work items warning**: Validation correctly identified orphaned items from previous testing sessions
3. **Progress propagation**: Progress updates properly propagated through the hierarchy as expected
