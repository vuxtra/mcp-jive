# MCP Tuple Serialization Bug - Comprehensive Debug Analysis

**Status**: üöß IN_PROGRESS | **Priority**: HIGH | **Last Updated**: 2025-08-24
**Issue**: `'tuple' object has no attribute 'name'` error in MCP client when listing tools

## Problem Summary

The MCP Jive server is experiencing a persistent serialization bug where `Tool` objects are being converted to tuples during the MCP protocol communication, causing the client to fail when trying to access the `name` attribute.

### Error Pattern
```
2025-08-24T09:49:16.720-04:00 [error] Got tools for mcp.config.usrlocalmcp.mcp-jive failed: MCP error 0: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'name'
```

### Key Observations
1. Server logs show tools are correctly retrieved as `mcp.types.Tool` objects
2. Server reports "Response sent" successfully
3. Error occurs on the CLIENT side when processing the response
4. All 8 tools are properly typed as `mcp.types.Tool` in server logs

## Investigation History

### Phase 1: Initial Fix Attempt ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-08-24 (earlier)
**Approach**: Created `mcp_serialization_fix.py` with monkey patches
**What was tried**:
- Patched `__iter__` methods of `ListToolsResult`, `CallToolResult`, `Tool`
- Added JSON serialization fixes
- Applied fixes during server startup

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Fixes applied successfully during server startup
- ‚úÖ Local verification tests passed
- ‚ùå Client-side error persists

**Analysis**: The fixes work in isolation but may not be affecting the actual MCP protocol serialization pathway.

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis üîç IN_PROGRESS
**Current Focus**: Understanding the exact serialization pathway in MCP protocol

## Technical Analysis

### Server-Side Evidence (Working)
```
2025-08-24 09:49:16,718 - mcp_jive.server - DEBUG - Tool 0: type=Tool, name=jive_manage_work_item
2025-08-24 09:49:16,718 - mcp_jive.server - DEBUG - Tool 0 class: mcp.types.Tool
```
- Tools are correctly typed as `mcp.types.Tool`
- Server successfully processes and sends response

### Client-Side Evidence (Failing)
```
[error] Got tools for mcp.config.usrlocalmcp.mcp-jive failed: MCP error 0: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'name'
```
- Client receives tuples instead of Tool objects
- Serialization corruption occurs during transport

### Hypothesis
The issue occurs in the MCP protocol's JSON-RPC serialization layer, specifically:
1. `ListToolsResult` is serialized to JSON correctly
2. During JSON deserialization on client side, `Tool` objects become tuples
3. This suggests the client-side deserialization is the problem, OR
4. The server-side JSON serialization is still producing tuple-like structures

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 2A: Deep MCP Protocol Analysis üîç NEXT
**Objective**: Understand exact serialization pathway

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Examine actual JSON being sent over the wire
- [ ] Trace MCP's `model_dump_json()` behavior for `ListToolsResult`
- [ ] Check if our patches are actually being applied to the right objects
- [ ] Verify MCP version compatibility

### Phase 2B: Transport Layer Investigation
**Objective**: Identify where tuple conversion happens

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Intercept JSON at transport layer
- [ ] Compare server JSON output vs client JSON input
- [ ] Check for MCP client-side deserialization issues

### Phase 2C: Alternative Fix Strategies
**Objective**: Try different approaches if current fixes insufficient

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Override MCP's serialization methods directly
- [ ] Custom JSON encoder for the entire response
- [ ] Patch at the transport layer instead of model layer

## Debugging Tools & Scripts

### Created Scripts
1. `verify_serialization_fix.py` - ‚úÖ Confirms fixes work in isolation
2. `simple_mcp_test.py` - ‚ùå Failed to properly test MCP protocol
3. `debug_mcp_internals.py` - ‚úÖ Revealed `__iter__` method as root cause

### Next Scripts Needed
1. `intercept_mcp_json.py` - Capture actual JSON being transmitted
2. `test_mcp_serialization_pathway.py` - Test the exact MCP serialization flow
3. `patch_verification.py` - Verify our patches are actually applied

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Are our patches actually being applied to the objects used by MCP?**
   - Status: ‚ùì UNKNOWN
   - Method: Check if patched methods are called during MCP response

2. **What does the actual JSON look like that's sent over the wire?**
   - Status: ‚ùì UNKNOWN
   - Method: Intercept stdio transport JSON

3. **Is this a client-side deserialization issue?**
   - Status: ‚ùì UNKNOWN
   - Method: Compare JSON sent vs received

4. **Are we patching the right MCP version/objects?**
   - Status: ‚ùì UNKNOWN
   - Method: Verify MCP version and object identity

## Success Criteria

- [ ] MCP client can successfully list tools without tuple errors
- [ ] All 8 tools are properly accessible with `.name` attribute
- [ ] Solution is robust and doesn't break other MCP functionality
- [ ] Fix is properly documented and maintainable

## Next Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Create JSON interception script to see actual wire format
2. **NEXT**: Verify our patches are applied to the actual objects used by MCP
3. **THEN**: If patches aren't working, try alternative serialization override
