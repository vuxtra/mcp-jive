# Temporary Documentation Directory

This directory contains temporary, draft, and experimental documentation files that were moved from the project root to maintain a clean repository structure.

## Purpose

This directory is for:
- **Development notes**: Analysis, troubleshooting, and implementation notes
- **Draft documentation**: Work-in-progress documentation and guides
- **Test reports**: Testing results, analysis, and debugging documentation
- **Implementation guides**: Temporary implementation notes and migration docs
- **Prompt files**: AI prompts and experimental conversation logs

## Naming Conventions

Documents in this directory typically follow these patterns:
- `*_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis and investigation documents
- `*_IMPLEMENTATION*.md` - Implementation guides and notes
- `*_TEST*.md` - Test reports and analysis
- `*_prompts.md` - AI prompt files and conversation logs
- `*_GUIDE.md` - Temporary guides and how-to documents
- `*_REPORT.md` - Status reports and summaries
- `*_DEBUG*.md` - Debugging and troubleshooting docs

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Temporary Nature**: Documents here are meant to be temporary and may be cleaned up periodically
2. **Draft Status**: These are working documents, not final documentation
3. **No Production Dependencies**: Don't link to these docs from production documentation
4. **Cleanup**: Move important content to proper documentation locations when finalized

## Organization

- **Analysis Documents**: Investigation and research notes
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical implementation details
- **Test Documentation**: Testing results and procedures
- **Development Logs**: Development process documentation
- **Prompt Files**: AI interaction logs and prompts

## Git Ignore

This entire directory is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean while allowing local development documentation.

## Document Count

Currently contains: **37 documents** moved from the project root.

## Important Documents Kept in Root

The following core documentation remains in the project root:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code development guidelines
- `RELEASES.md` - Release management information
- `MCP_JIVE_COMPREHENSIVE_TEST.md` - Comprehensive test results
