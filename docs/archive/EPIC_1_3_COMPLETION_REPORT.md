### 2. Tab Component Integration ✅

#### Architecture Memory Tab Updates
**File:** `frontend/src/components/tabs/ArchitectureMemoryTab.tsx`

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState<ArchitectureItem | null>(null);
const [isDeleteDialogOpen, setIsDeleteDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [itemToDelete, setItemToDelete] = useState<ArchitectureItem | null>(null);
const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false);
```

**New Handlers:**
- `handleOpenCreateModal()` - Opens modal for creating new items
- `handleOpenEditModal(item)` - Opens modal with selected item for editing
- `handleCloseModal()` - Closes modal and resets state
- `handleSave(itemData)` - Saves (creates or updates) item via API
  - Automatically determines action based on `selectedItem`
  - Shows success/error notifications
  - Reloads items on success
- `handleOpenDeleteDialog(item)` - Opens delete confirmation
- `handleCloseDeleteDialog()` - Closes delete dialog
- `handleConfirmDelete()` - Executes delete via API
  - Shows loading state
  - Handles errors gracefully
  - Reloads items on success

**Button Integrations:**
- Toolbar "New Architecture" button → `handleOpenCreateModal()`
- Empty state "Create Architecture Item" button → `handleOpenCreateModal()`
- Table row Edit icon → `handleOpenEditModal(item)`
- Table row Delete icon → `handleOpenDeleteDialog(item)`

**Modal Rendering:**
```tsx
<ArchitectureMemoryModal
  open={isModalOpen}
  onClose={handleCloseModal}
  onSave={handleSave}
  item={selectedItem}
/>

<ConfirmDeleteDialog
  open={isDeleteDialogOpen}
  onClose={handleCloseDeleteDialog}
  onConfirm={handleConfirmDelete}
  title="Delete Architecture Item"
  itemName={itemToDelete?.title}
  description="This will permanently delete this architecture item and all associated data."
  isDeleting={isDeleting}
/>
```

#### Troubleshoot Memory Tab Updates
**File:** `frontend/src/components/tabs/TroubleshootMemoryTab.tsx`

**Same pattern as Architecture Tab:**
- All state variables added
- All handlers implemented
- All buttons wired up
- Both modals rendered
- Success rate visualization maintained

**Unique Features:**
- Delete confirmation includes note about usage statistics
- Success rate display in table with color-coded LinearProgress bars

### 3. API Integration ✅

Both tab components make proper API calls to:
```typescript
POST /api/memory
```

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "memory_type": "architecture" | "troubleshoot",
  "action": "create" | "update" | "delete",
  ...itemData
}
```

**Response Handling:**
- Success: Shows snackbar notification and reloads list
- Error: Shows error snackbar with details
- Proper error handling with try/catch blocks

**Namespace Awareness:**
- All requests include `X-Namespace` header
- Correctly uses `currentNamespace` from context
- Defaults to "default" namespace if not set
