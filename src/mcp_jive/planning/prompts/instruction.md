**Task**: {task_name}
**Complexity**: {complexity}
**Instruction Detail Level**: {detail_level}

## Context
- **Description**: {description}
- **Acceptance Criteria**: {acceptance_criteria}
- **Technical Context**: {context_tags}
- **Prerequisites**: {prerequisites}

# Instruction Generation Guidelines

Create clear, actionable, step-by-step instructions that guide an AI agent through the implementation process. Instructions should be detailed enough to ensure successful completion while being efficient and focused.

## Instruction Structure

### Overview
**Objective**: [Clear statement of what will be accomplished]
**Approach**: [High-level implementation strategy]
**Expected Outcome**: [What the final result should be]

### Prerequisites Check
Before starting implementation, verify:
- [ ] [Prerequisite 1]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 2]
- [ ] [Required tools and dependencies available]
- [ ] [Access to necessary resources]

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: [Step Name]
**Purpose**: [Why this step is necessary]
**Action**: [Specific action to take]

**Detailed Instructions**:
1. [Specific sub-action 1]
   - Command/Code: `[exact command or code snippet]`
   - Expected Result: [What should happen]
   - Validation: [How to verify success]

2. [Specific sub-action 2]
   - [Continue with detailed sub-steps]

**Success Criteria**: [How to know this step is complete]
**Troubleshooting**: [Common issues and solutions]

#### Step 2: [Step Name]
[Continue for all implementation steps]

### Validation and Testing

#### Functional Validation
1. **Test Scenario**: [Description of test]
   - **Input**: [Test input or conditions]
   - **Expected Output**: [Expected result]
   - **Validation Command**: `[command to run test]`

2. **Test Scenario**: [Continue for all test scenarios]

#### Quality Checks
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Error handling is implemented appropriately
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed successfully
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for deployment/integration

## Instruction Detail Levels

### High Detail (Beginner-Friendly)
- Include exact commands and code snippets
- Explain the reasoning behind each step
- Provide extensive troubleshooting guidance
- Include multiple validation checkpoints
- Explain expected outputs in detail

### Medium Detail (Standard)
- Provide clear step-by-step guidance
- Include key commands and code examples
- Explain critical decision points
- Include essential validation steps
- Provide troubleshooting for common issues

### Low Detail (Expert-Level)
- Focus on high-level approach and key decisions
- Provide minimal but essential guidance
- Highlight critical considerations and gotchas
- Include validation of final outcomes
- Assume familiarity with tools and processes

## Best Practices for Instructions

### Clarity
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Provide concrete examples
- Define technical terms when necessary

### Completeness
- Cover all necessary steps for completion
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Provide validation for each major step
- Include cleanup and finalization steps

### Actionability
- Make each step actionable and specific
- Provide exact commands when possible
- Include file paths, variable names, and parameters
- Specify tools and versions when relevant

### Safety
- Include warnings for potentially destructive operations
- Recommend backup procedures when appropriate
- Highlight security considerations
- Suggest testing in safe environments first

## Common Instruction Patterns

### Code Implementation
1. Set up development environment
2. Create/modify necessary files
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling and validation
5. Write tests
6. Update documentation
7. Perform integration testing

### Configuration Changes
1. Backup current configuration
2. Identify configuration files to modify
3. Make incremental changes
4. Validate each change
5. Test functionality
6. Document changes made

### Integration Tasks
1. Understand integration requirements
2. Set up connection/authentication
3. Implement data mapping
4. Handle error scenarios
5. Test integration thoroughly
6. Monitor and validate

### Deployment Tasks
1. Prepare deployment package
2. Verify deployment environment
3. Execute deployment steps
4. Validate deployment success
5. Monitor for issues
6. Rollback plan if needed
