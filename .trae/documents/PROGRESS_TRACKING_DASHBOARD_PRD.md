## 1. Product Overview

The Progress Tracking Service provides server-side progress calculation, metrics aggregation, and status monitoring for agile workflow execution through MCP tools. This is a **server-side only** service with **no UI/UX components** - all interactions occur through MCP protocol tools.

This component serves as the backend MCP service for progress monitoring, providing 4 core MCP tools for AI agents and clients to track progress, generate reports, set milestones, and access analytics.

**Critical Architectural Constraint**: The Progress Tracking Service **NEVER** directly accesses MCP Client code projects or local file systems. All progress data and file-related operations are coordinated through the MCP Client, ensuring proper security boundaries and separation of concerns between the tracking service and client file systems.

**Implementation Status**: 100% complete with 4 core MCP tools implemented (`track_progress`, `get_progress_report`, `set_milestone`, `get_analytics`) and comprehensive progress calculation engine, plus validation and quality gate tools.

## 3. Core Process

### Progress Tracking Flow (MCP Tool: `track_progress`)

1. AI agent or client calls `track_progress` MCP tool
2. Validate progress data and entity permissions
3. Calculate status based on progress and timeline
4. Store progress entry in database
5. Check for milestone achievements
6. Return progress tracking response with status
7. Log progress update for analytics

### Progress Reporting Flow (MCP Tool: `get_progress_report`)

1. Client calls `get_progress_report` MCP tool
2. Filter progress entries by criteria
3. Group data by specified parameters
4. Generate summary statistics
5. Include analytics if requested
6. Return comprehensive progress report
7. Cache results for performance

### Milestone Management Flow (MCP Tool: `set_milestone`)

1. Client calls `set_milestone` MCP tool
2. Create milestone with target date and criteria
3. Associate with relevant work items
4. Store milestone in database
5. Calculate days until target
6. Return milestone confirmation
7. Monitor for achievement triggers

### Analytics Generation Flow (MCP Tool: `get_analytics`)

1. Client calls `get_analytics` MCP tool with analysis type
2. Filter data by time period and entity filters
3. Generate analytics based on requested type
4. Calculate performance metrics and trends
5. Include predictions if requested
6. Return comprehensive analytics data
7. Cache complex calculations for efficiency
