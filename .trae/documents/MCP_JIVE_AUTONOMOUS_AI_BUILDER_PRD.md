## 1. Product Overview

MCP Jive is an autonomous AI code building system that enables AI agents to develop software with minimal human intervention through a **refined minimal set of 16 essential MCP tools** - streamlined from 47 original tools while maintaining core functionality for agile workflow management, memory systems, and architecture steering.

The system addresses the critical need for AI agents to work autonomously on complex software projects by providing structured task decomposition, progress tracking, and intelligent context management across multiple development environments using only the most essential tools.

**Critical Architectural Principle**: The MCP Server **NEVER** directly accesses MCP Client code projects or local file systems. The MCP Client is **SOLELY RESPONSIBLE** for all local file operations within client projects. All file-related operations are coordinated through the MCP Client and communicated to the server via the MCP protocol, ensuring proper security boundaries, separation of concerns, and preventing unauthorized access to client codebases.

Target market value: Revolutionize AI-assisted software development by enabling truly autonomous coding workflows that can handle enterprise-scale projects with maximum efficiency and minimal tool complexity.

## 3. Core Process

### Developer Flow

1. Developer installs MCP Jive server locally
2. Configures environment variables and .env files
3. Connects preferred code editor (VSCode, Cursor, Trae, etc.)
4. Creates or imports PRD document
5. Uses AI agent to decompose PRD into agile hierarchy
6. Monitors progress through dashboard
7. Reviews and validates completed work

### AI Agent Flow

1. AI agent connects to MCP server via client
2. Receives task execution request (Epic, Feature, Story, or Task)
3. Retrieves task details and dependencies from Weaviate
4. Executes work items in dependency order
5. Updates progress and validates completion
6. Triggers execution of dependent tasks
7. Reports completion status to developer

### Task Decomposition Flow

1. PRD input received
2. AI agent analyzes requirements
3. Creates Initiative level objectives
4. Breaks down into Epics with business value
5. Decomposes Epics into Features
6. Creates Stories with user value
7. Defines Tasks with implementation steps
8. Establishes dependencies and relationships
9. Stores in both local files and Weaviate
