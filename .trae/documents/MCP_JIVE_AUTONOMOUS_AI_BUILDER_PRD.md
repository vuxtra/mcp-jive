## 3. Core Process

### Developer Flow

1. Developer installs MCP Jive server locally
2. Configures environment variables and .env files
3. Connects preferred code editor (VSCode, Cursor, Trae, etc.)
4. Creates or imports PRD document
5. Uses AI agent to decompose PRD into agile hierarchy
6. Monitors progress through dashboard
7. Reviews and validates completed work

### AI Agent Flow

1. AI agent connects to MCP server via client
2. Receives task execution request (Epic, Feature, Story, or Task)
3. Retrieves task details and dependencies from Weaviate
4. Executes work items in dependency order
5. Updates progress and validates completion
6. Triggers execution of dependent tasks
7. Reports completion status to developer

### Task Decomposition Flow

1. PRD input received
2. AI agent analyzes requirements
3. Creates Initiative level objectives
4. Breaks down into Epics with business value
5. Decomposes Epics into Features
6. Creates Stories with user value
7. Defines Tasks with implementation steps
8. Establishes dependencies and relationships
9. Stores in both local files and Weaviate
